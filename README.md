## Installation

1. Open **Nextcloud → Apps → Tools**, search for **FinTrack**, and click **Download and enable**.
   - Or install manually: download the latest release from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cloudsliberty/fintrack), extract it into your Nextcloud `apps/` directory as `apps/fintrack`, then enable it under **Settings → Apps**.
2. Requires **Nextcloud 32**.
3. Open FinTrack from the Nextcloud app menu.

## Getting started

1. **Add an account** — go to *Accounts*, choose a type (Asset, Liability, or Expense) and currency.
2. **Set your base currency** — *Settings → Currencies* — this is the currency all cross-account totals are shown in.
3. **Add a transaction** — *Transactions → Add* — pick an account, amount, category, and (optionally) tags and notes.
4. Optional next steps: set up a [budget](#budgets), a [recurring transaction](#recurring-transactions), the [external entry form](#external-entry-form--api) for quick mobile entry, or a [Pin Lock](#pin-lock) PIN.

## Feature guide

### Accounts

Four account types, each serving a different purpose:

| Type | Use for |
|---|---|
| **Asset** | Bank accounts, cash, savings, investments — anything you own |
| **Liability** | Credit cards, loans — anything you owe |
| **Revenue** | Income-source buckets (e.g. "Salary", "Freelance") for income-tracking without a real linked account |
| **Expense** | Spending-category buckets (e.g. "Groceries", "Rent") for expense-tracking without a real linked account |

Each account has its own currency, icon, and color, and can be archived
(marked inactive) without deleting its transaction history.

### Transactions

Income or expense entries against an account: amount, description,
category, tags (free-text, autosuggested from previously used tags),
notes, and date. Foreign-currency accounts can carry a per-transaction
**conversion rate**, frozen at entry time, so editing your currency table
later never silently re-prices historical transactions.

### Transfers

Move money between two accounts in one step. If the accounts use
different currencies, FinTrack converts the amount automatically (with an
editable rate) and records both legs. Account pickers support fuzzy
search for people with many accounts.

### Recurring transactions

Set up a transaction template with a frequency (daily / weekly / monthly
/ yearly) and FinTrack posts it automatically on schedule in the
background — no need to open the app on the due date. The Dashboard
surfaces everything due in the next 5 days so nothing is a surprise, and
you can post an occurrence manually early if needed.

### Budgets

Set a spending limit per category (or overall) for a monthly or custom
period, in any currency, and track progress with a live progress bar as
transactions come in.

### Categories & tags

Categories are typed (income / expense / transfer) and carry an icon and
color. Tags are free-text and shared across all your transactions with
autosuggest. Categories can be exported/imported as a set, or generated
from a sensible built-in default list (Groceries, Rent/Mortgage,
Entertainment, etc.) with one click.

### Multi-currency

Add any number of currencies with a code, symbol, and exchange rate
relative to your base currency. Rates can be entered manually or fetched
online — FinTrack tries [Frankfurter](https://api.frankfurter.dev) first
(free, no API key needed), then falls back to
[exchangerate.host](https://exchangerate.host) (requires a free API key,
set in *Settings → Currency Rate API Key*) for currency pairs Frankfurter
doesn't cover, such as SAR or AED. Every transaction, transfer, and total
correctly distinguishes between "priced in this account's currency" and
"converted to your base currency for reporting" — and conversions always
prefer a transaction's own frozen rate over today's live rate, so past
totals stay stable.

### Dashboard & reports

- Account balances and net worth at a glance
- Income vs. expense trends over time
- Spending broken down by category
- Asset allocation across accounts
- Upcoming recurring transactions due soon
- Filterable transaction reports by account, category, type, and date range

### CSV import / export

Export all transactions to CSV or a full JSON backup. Import a CSV with a
downloadable template as a starting point; FinTrack shows a **column
mapping summary** (which file header matched which field) and a **preview
table** before anything is committed, with duplicate, update, and invalid
rows clearly flagged. Optional rule-based auto-categorization fills in a
category from the description when the file doesn't specify one. Every
row that fails validation is reported individually — row number, the
column that failed, and why — in an Import Results dialog after the
import runs, instead of just a pass/fail count.

Re-importing a file you've exported **updates** matching transactions
instead of duplicating them: each transaction carries a permanent
`unique-key(for-updating)` — simply its own row id — included
automatically in every export. Leave that column blank on a row to create
a new transaction instead.

### External entry form & API

*Settings → External Access* gives you a token and a shareable link that
lets you (or an automation) add transactions **without logging into
Nextcloud** — handy for a phone home-screen shortcut, a browser
bookmarklet, or a script. Authenticated by a single API token rather than
a Nextcloud session. See [REST API](#rest-api) below for the full
request/response format. Both the token and the form link are masked in
Settings and require your Pin Lock PIN to reveal or copy, if one is set.
Opening the link offers to install itself as an app — titled
"FinTrack - `<your-domain>`" with the same icon as the main app, so
multiple instances stay distinguishable on your home screen — with an
explicit Yes / Maybe Later / Cancel choice remembered locally in your
browser.

### Pin Lock

An optional PIN layered on top of your normal Nextcloud login — useful on
a shared device or if your Nextcloud session stays logged in. Includes an
auto-lock timeout after inactivity, lockout after repeated failed
attempts, a self-service security-question reset, and an
admin-approval reset flow for when both the PIN and the security answer
are forgotten.

Once a PIN is set, choose exactly which actions require it under
**Protected Actions**: exporting transactions to CSV, importing
transactions from CSV, viewing Recently Deleted, and/or the External
Entry Form — each is its own checkbox, on by default except the External
Entry Form (opt-in, since it affects anyone with the form link, not just
you).

### Settings, backup & reset

Configure base currency, tags, category rules, the external API token,
and Pin Lock from one Settings screen. Deleting an account or transaction
always asks for confirmation first — account deletion adds a 3-second
cancellable countdown on top, since it can't be undone. Deleted
transactions aren't gone immediately either: the last 100 land in
**Recently Deleted** (a recycle bin) and can be restored any time, or
purged for good. A full backup is written to Nextcloud Files automatically
before any full data reset, and settings can be restored from a previous
backup.

## REST API

FinTrack exposes two API surfaces:

- **`/api/*`** — the full internal API (accounts, transactions, transfers,
  budgets, categories, currencies, recurring rules, settings, summary).
  Authenticated by your live Nextcloud session; this is what the web UI
  itself uses.
- **`/external/*`** — a smaller, public, **token-authenticated** API
  (`X-FinTrack-Token` header) for quick transaction entry from outside
  Nextcloud — no session or cookies required. Get your token from
  *Settings → External Access*.

Full endpoint list, request/response shapes, and integration examples
(including a ready-to-use spec for building your own client) are in the
[admin manual](docs/MANUAL.md).

## Data & privacy

All data lives in your own Nextcloud database — accounts, transactions,
budgets, and settings never leave your server. The only optional external
calls FinTrack makes are to Frankfurter and/or exchangerate.host for
live exchange rates, and only if you enable online rate lookups;
everything else works fully offline within your Nextcloud instance.

## Requirements

- Nextcloud **32**
- PHP as required by your Nextcloud installation
- No additional services required (exchange-rate API is optional)
